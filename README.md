# RestFull-Book-Store-API

ðŸ‘‰ **INTRODUCTION**

The Book Store API is a backend application built with Spring Boot that manages books and authors in a digital library. The project allows users to add, update, retrieve, and delete book information while maintaining author details. It also supports pagination and sorting, making it easy to browse large collections. To ensure data accuracy, I used Spring Boot Starter Validation for validating inputs, and integrated Swagger API for interactive documentation and testing.

ðŸ“Œ **Main modules of the project include:**

ðŸ”¹ Book Module â€“ Handles all operations related to books.

ðŸ”¹ Author Module â€“ Manages author details and connects them with books.

ðŸ”¹ Validation & Exception Handling â€“ Ensures data correctness and meaningful error messages.

ðŸ”¹ Pagination & Sorting â€“ Enables efficient data retrieval for large datasets.

ðŸ›  **Tools Used**

ðŸ”¹ Spring Boot â€“ For building the RESTful application.

ðŸ”¹ Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) â€“ For database operations.

ðŸ”¹ MySQL â€“ As the relational database.

ðŸ”¹ Swagger (OpenAPI) â€“ For API documentation and testing.

ðŸ”¹ Lombok â€“ To reduce boilerplate code.

ðŸ”¹ Spring Boot Starter Validation â€“ To validate user inputs.
